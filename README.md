**💊 Drug Recommendation System**

**🌟 Overview**

The Drug Recommendation System is an AI-powered tool that suggests suitable drugs based on patient reviews and medical conditions. It integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze drug effectiveness, sentiment, and patient feedback.

This system helps healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions by leveraging patient reviews, conditions, and ratings.

**🔍 Features**

✅ AI-Powered Drug Recommendation – Uses ML models to predict the most effective drug.  
✅ Sentiment Analysis – Analyzes patient reviews to understand user experiences.  
✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleans and preprocesses medical datasets for accurate predictions.  
✅ Multiple ML Models – Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Ridge Classifier, SGD, and MLP.  
✅ Performance Comparison – Visualizes the accuracy and efficiency of different models.

**🎯 How It Works**

1️⃣ Load Patient Review Dataset – The system takes drug reviews and medical conditions as input.  
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing – The dataset is cleaned, and features are extracted using TF-IDF.  
3️⃣ Train ML Models – Multiple algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, and MLP are trained.  
4️⃣ Make Predictions – Based on patient reviews, the system recommends the best drug.  
5️⃣ Performance Comparison – The accuracy of different models is displayed as a bar chart.
